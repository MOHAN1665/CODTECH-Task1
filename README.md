## Overview of the Project

### Project: LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

### Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle categorical and numerical features effectively, and evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics.

### Key Activities
- **Data Preprocessing**: Imputation for missing values in numerical features using the mean..
- **Model Development**: Implemented a pipeline combining preprocessing and a linear regression model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R² score to measure model accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**:
      - **Pipeline**: Streamlined preprocessing and modeling steps.
      - **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting housing prices.
      - **Metrics**: Evaluated the model using RMSE and R².

### Results
- **RMSE**: Indicates the standard deviation of residuals, representing prediction errors.
- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

### Key Insights
- **Feature Importance**: Preprocessing steps significantly influence the performance of linear regression.
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE and R² scores provide insights into model accuracy and predictive reliability.

This project showcases the effective use of pipelines for preprocessing and predictive modeling, emphasizing the importance of feature handling and performance evaluation in regression tasks.
